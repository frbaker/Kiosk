Proceeds and Agreements:
I’d propose a revenue share that is split 4 ways:
Kiosk location (the Owner of the kiosk location should acquire a portion of proceeds for ads that are displayed on their kiosk - we can use analytics and create an algorithm that measure effectiveness so that high performing kiosks receive more than low performing kiosks) - but the overall amount possible to be received by all kiosks location owners would be limited to ¼ of the net profits per the same period of time measured.
BNS (The tourism association should receive a portion of proceeds for ads that are procured through their efforts) 
Mariner Robotics Team (The robotics team should receive a portion of the proceeds for ads that are run on displays developed in association with the robotics team (not to exceed ¼ of the net profit per the same period of time measured)
Area 61 will retain all intellectual property for the ad players and reserves the right to resell the same services to any third party without limitation. Any Inventions created by any of the robotics team members on their own will remain their own IP, however if Area 61 is providing the direction, guidance, and step by step instructions to produce a result it will remain Area 61 IP as if it were a work for hire.
